### Notes
- Th challenge that I faced was the merge conflict that I had with Github.
For this issue, the Xcode project didn't allow me to load it up. I had to fix it 
first before continuing opening the project. 
- I was also spending quite a bit of time on doing the trailer view from the poster image
